# Image Augmentation

[For full details]()

In this code we pay a special attention how intensity transformation and neighborhood filtering was done and how it change the nature of the images. 

Intensity transformation involves changing an image's pixel values to change its general brightness, contrast, or other properties. The main objective of intensity modification is to enhance the visual appeal of an image or to draw attention to certain elements in order to facilitate further analysis.

In this codes we pay a special attention to
* Piece wise Linear Transformation 
* Histogram Equalization
* Gamma correction
* Thresholding

Neighborhood filtering is a technique which is used in wide range of image enhancement techniques such as noise reduction, edge detection, blurring, sharpening, and more.

In this codes we pay a special   attention to
* Smoothing Filters (Low-Pass Filters)
* Edge Detection Filters
* Custom Filters

And in advance we looked into some special cases

***In this project, we have developed code to achieve two key image processing tasks. First, we employ binary masking with thresholding and the advanced GrabCut algorithm to effectively separate the foreground from the background in images. Second, we provide a solution to create portrait-style images by applying background blurring, enhancing the subject's prominence.***
